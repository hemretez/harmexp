This project is implemented in Processing. (It can be easily ported to Javascript.)

The areas such as physics, music visualization, 2D displays and force-feedback have great potentials for discovering new musical interaction ways. In this research, these fields, which have never been put together before, will be investigated, analyzed and combined to explore new ways of musical interaction for composition on tablets using probabilistic models of tonality. The interface will have inherent music knowledge (expert agents) which will be integrated in order to give intuition about tonal movements via the objects on 2D space. The action of these objects are designed in the light of these diverse areas.
